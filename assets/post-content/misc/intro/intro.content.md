Animations can be both fun and frustrating to build, and I came to realize that there are a lot of different ways to choose from when it comes to implementing an animation. This makes building out animations really flexible, but at the same time could also be overwhelming given the number of options.

This project is a demo for "In-Depth guide into animations in Angular" on indepth.dev, with the goal of providing a live version of all the methods covered in the article that you could explore and play around with.

> _This is not meant to be as comprehensive or a replacement for documentation, but rather a quick way to showcase the different animation methods that are available, look at their behavior and some use cases, and the code behind the implementation._
